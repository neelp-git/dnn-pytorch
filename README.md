Deep neural networks with Pytorch [(Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-networks-with-pytorch))

Key DNN concepts covered with Pytorch code:
- Dataset - training, validation, test split

- Differentiation
- Loss
- Gradient descent
- Optimization
- Weights and bias
- Linear regression, Logistic regression, 
  - Stochastic, mini-batch
  - Multiple in/output
  - Classification and cross-entropy loss
- Softmax function/prediction for highest value class
- Deep neural networks with multiple Hidden layers
  - Backpropagation
  - Activation functions: sigmoid, tanh, relu
  - Dropout, regularization
  - Initialization - default, xavier, he
  - Batch normalization
  - Momentum
- Convolution
  - Padding
  - Max pooling
